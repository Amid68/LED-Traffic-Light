# Arduino LED Traffic Light

This project simulates a basic traffic light using an Arduino and LEDs. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly project designed to teach the basics of digital pin control and timing in Arduino.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs
- Resistors
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Getting Started
1. **Circuit:** Connect the LEDs to digital pins 9, 10, and 11 with resistors.
2. **Code:** Upload the provided code to your Arduino.
3. **Run:** Observe the LEDs cycle through red, yellow, and green, simulating a traffic light.
